## Features

  - All the Minesweeper rules
  - State of the art graphics
  - Automatic game saving when quitting. If there's a saved game it is automatically loaded, too
  - Stats
  - Sound effects!

## Prerequisites

Python 3. May eventually works with Python 2 (not tested).

## Installation

Clone this repo, and then the usual `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Usage

```
python run.py
```

### Controls

  - <kbd>ESC</kbd> closes the game
  - <kbd>F1</kbd> starts a new game
  - <kbd>F2</kbd> displays stats
  - <kbd>LMB</kbd> clears an area
  - <kbd>RMB</kbd> place a mine marker on an area

## How it works

This game is built on top of [PyGame](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html). I obviously can't explain how it
works here, so you'll have to jump yourself in the source code. Start with the entry point, `run.py`.

Beside the game itself, I use [PyInstaller](http://www.pyinstaller.org/) to generate the executables. It packs
up all the game and its assets in a single executable file so players just have to run it with nothing to install.
This task is performed by the `build_*` scripts to be run in the corresponding OS.
